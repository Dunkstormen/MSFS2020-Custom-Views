# MSFS2020-Custom-Views
This is a collection of custom camera views for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020.

### How to install
To use the custom camera views the configuration file ```CAMERAS.CFG``` needs to saved into one of the following folders, depending on where you've purchased the game.

**Steam path:** ```%APPDATA%\Roaming\Microsoft Flight Simulator\SimObjects\Airplanes\<AIRCRAFT>```

**Microsoft Store Path:** 
```%LOCALAPPDATA%\Packages\Microsoft.FlightSimulator_8wekyb3d8bbwe\LocalCache\SimObjects\Airplanes\<AIRCRAFT>```

When using the custom views please make sure you're in cockpit mode, as they don't work in External or Showcase mode.

### Keybindings
If you're flying using your keyboard I recommend using the default keybindings provided in the game, as seen on the image below.

If you're flying using a joystick I recommend using the numpad, as seen on the image below.

### Screenshot examples
I've provided a few screenshot examples for you to have a look at in the [EXAMPLES folder](https://github.com/Dunkstormen/MSFS2020-Custom-Views/tree/main/EXAMPLES) for each aircraft.

### Suggestions
Do you have a custom view position for an existing aircraft you want added? Or perhaps you've created a set of custom views for a custom/modded aircraft, that you would like to see added to this repository? Feel free to open an issue or pull request.
